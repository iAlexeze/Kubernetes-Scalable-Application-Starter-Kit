## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The Kubernetes Scalable Application Starter Kit provides a solid foundation for building and deploying scalable applications on Kubernetes. It includes essential configuration files and deployment templates that adhere to best practices, enabling you to leverage Kubernetes' power and flexibility.

## Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with this starter kit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
        
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubernetes-scalable-app-starter-kit.git


2. Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I have provided a configuration to setup a multi-node Kind Kubernetes [Cluster](#cluster-configuration)

3. Navigate to the cloned repository:

        cd kubernetes-scalable-app-starter-kit


4. Modify the configuration files in the respective directories to suit your application requirements.

5. Deploy the components using the provided deployment files and commands. For example, to deploy the NGINX application, run:
        
        kubectl apply -f deployment/nginx_deploy.yml


## Cluster Configuration<a name="cluster-configuration"></a>

The `cluster` directory contains the `cluster-config.yaml` file, which holds the configuration for your Kubernetes cluster. Modify this file to define the desired state of your cluster, including settings such as network policies, authentication, and RBAC.

## Dashboard<a name="dashboard"></a>

The `dashboard` directory contains the `dash.yml` file, which allows you to deploy the Kubernetes Dashboard. The Dashboard provides a web-based user interface to monitor and manage your cluster. Once deployed, you can access the Dashboard and gain insights into your cluster's health and performance.

To deploy the Kubernetes Dashboard, run:

        kubectl apply -f dashboard/dash.yml


## Deployment<a name="deployment"></a>

The `deployment` directory contains example deployment files, such as `nginx_deploy.yml`, which demonstrate how to deploy applications on Kubernetes. Modify these files to define your application's deployment strategy, including the number of replicas, resource limits, and networking settings.

To deploy the NGINX application, run:

        kubectl apply -f deployment/nginx_deploy.yml


## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler<a name="horizontal-pod-autoscaler"></a>

The `hpa` directory contains two important files: `hpa_config.yaml` and `load_generator.sh`. The `hpa_config.yaml` file defines the autoscaling behavior for your application based on CPU utilization or other metrics. The `load_generator.sh` script helps simulate load on your application, allowing you to observe the autoscaling in action.

To configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, modify the `hpa_config.yaml` file according to your requirements.

## MetalLB<a name="metallb"></a>

The `metallb` directory provides two essential files: `config.yml` and `metallb-native.yaml`. MetalLB is a load balancer implementation for Kubernetes, designed to enable bare metal services. The `config.yml` file allows you to configure MetalLB, while the `metallb-native.yaml` file provides an example of how to deploy MetalLB in your cluster.

To deploy MetalLB in your cluster, run:

       kubectl apply -f metallb/metallb-native.yaml


## Metrics<a name="metrics"></a>

The `metrics` directory contains the `components.yaml` file, which sets up the necessary components for collecting and exporting metrics from your cluster. These metrics can be visualized and analyzed using various monitoring solutions, allowing you to gain insights into the performance and health of your applications.

To deploy the metrics components, run:

       kubectl apply -f metrics/components.yaml

## Pod Configuration<a name="pod-configuration"></a>

The `pod` directory holds example pod configuration files, such as `nginx_pod.yml`, which demonstrate how to define and deploy individual pods on Kubernetes. You can modify these files to create pods for your specific application components and customize them according to your requirements.

To deploy a pod, run:

       kubectl apply -f pod/nginx_pod.yml

## ReplicaSet<a name="replicaset"></a>

The `replicaset` directory provides example ReplicaSet files, such as `nginx_rs.yml`, which showcase the usage of ReplicaSets in Kubernetes. ReplicaSets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time, allowing you to maintain high availability and scalability for your application.

To deploy a ReplicaSet, run:

       kubectl apply -f replicaset/nginx_rs.yml
